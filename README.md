# User-Centered-Product-Design-and-Marketing-Optimization

 This is an ongoing project focused on improving Rare Beauty’s digital presence through a blend of design, marketing analysis, and strategic thinking. The goal is to explore how the brand can better connect with its audience across every stage of the marketing and sales funnel. The project began with a strategic article outlining Rare Beauty’s user journey and identifying friction points using the AARRR and HEART frameworks. From there, the initiative branches into four key tracks:

🔧 **Web Interface Redesign (Figma):** Creating a more intuitive, conversion-optimized UI with features like an expanded “Find Your Shade” quiz and improved mobile navigation.

📊 **Social Media Analysis (Tableau + Adobe):** Using Instagram data to identify trends in engagement, post performance, and content strategy. Designing and testing visual ad variations with simulated engagement data to determine what drives user interaction.

🧠 **Brand Strategy Insights:** Synthesizing visual, functional, and emotional elements of Rare Beauty’s digital presence to propose data-backed strategies for acquisition, retention, and referral.

This project serves as both a design portfolio and a strategic case study — showcasing how thoughtful UX, brand positioning, and data storytelling can work together to drive digital growth.
