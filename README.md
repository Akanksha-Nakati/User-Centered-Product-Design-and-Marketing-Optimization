# User-Centered-Product-Design-and-Marketing-Optimization

 This is an ongoing project focused on improving Rare Beauty’s digital presence through a blend of design, marketing analysis, and strategic thinking. The goal is to explore how the brand can better connect with its audience across every stage of the marketing and sales funnel. The project began with a strategic article outlining Rare Beauty’s user journey and identifying friction points using the AARRR and HEART frameworks. From there, the initiative branches into four key tracks:

🔧 **Web Interface Redesign (Figma):** Creating a more intuitive, conversion-optimized UI with features like an expanded “Find Your Shade” quiz and improved mobile navigation.

🧠 **Brand Strategy Insights:** Synthesizing visual, functional, and emotional elements of Rare Beauty’s digital presence to propose data-backed strategies for acquisition, retention, and referral.

This project serves as both a design portfolio and a strategic case study — showcasing how thoughtful UX, brand positioning, and data storytelling can work together to drive digital growth.

## Rare Beauty Marketing Dashboard (Simulated Data + ETL Pipeline)

📊 An end-to-end marketing analytics project built to analyze Rare Beauty’s campaign performance, financial efficiency, and audience engagement using simulated data.

This project is not based on real data—it uses simulated datasets created to reflect real-world marketing challenges in the beauty industry. The data was processed through a custom ETL pipeline in MySQL before being visualized in Tableau Public.

🚀 Project Workflow

Data Simulation

Created marketing datasets (spend, revenue, engagement, audience segments, product sales) to mirror realistic campaign performance.

ETL Pipeline in MySQL

Extract → Simulated data imported into staging tables.

Transform → Cleaned, aggregated, and joined across campaign, audience, and product dimensions.

Load → Final fact and dimension tables structured for Tableau consumption.

Visualization in Tableau Public

Developed five dashboards to showcase strategic insights.

📂 Dashboards

Executive Dashboard → Revenue, ROAS, CPA, Conversions overview.

Campaign Dashboard → Active campaigns, budget pacing, CTR, alerts.

Financial Dashboard → Budget vs. optimal spend, variance, efficiency score.

Product Dashboard → Top product performance, funnel conversion analysis.

Audience Dashboard → Reach, engagement, LTV, demographic breakdown.

🔑 Key Insights (Simulated)

Email Marketing → Underfunded but top ROI driver.

Google Ads → High revenue channel but underinvested.

Meta & Pinterest Ads → Overfunded, leading to inefficiencies.

Holiday Lip Set → Strong seasonal performer with high conversions.

Gen Z & Beauty Enthusiasts → Most engaged and profitable audience segment.

🛠️ Tools & Tech

MySQL → ETL pipeline (staging → transformation → reporting tables).

Tableau Public → Dashboard creation & visualization.

Excel / CSV → Initial simulated dataset creation.
